## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Lendi claims that “the process of securing a home loan can be one of the most stressful and overwhelming experiences of a person’s life”. Lendi aims to solve the time and efficiency issues of the mortgage application process. Using smart technology, Lendi has been able to speed up and streamline the mortgage comparison and application process for its users, while maintaining a fully digital platform, and being independent of the banks.

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Lendi tagets retail mortgage customers of any size.
According to Lendi Group, In May 2021, prior to the merger with Aussie, the Lendi had a loan book of over $70 billion, which equates to a home loan market share of 5 per cent and a broker market share of almost 10% percent.


### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
While there are similar “digital” lender offerings, Lendi, being a brokerage can offer comparison and suitability of over 2,500 products from 35 different lenders for its customers. Furthermore, Lendi allows the customer to select which products are suitable and control the application process. Other digital lenders may be able to provide faster approval times but, since they are mainly mortgage managers, they are only able to offer a select amount of their “own” white-labelled products. Similarly, these lenders may only be able to approve applications which they have risk appetite for. Whereas, in the case of Lendi, it is the applied lender that determines this risk.


### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
Since inception, Lendi’s platform has been built on and developed on Heroku, a cloud platform, however in August 2021, Lendi announced that they were using Google Cloud services for artificial intelligence and machine learning to help it automate and speed up data-intensive aspects of the home loan origination process. Through AI/ML, Lendi seeks to solve data-related pain points such as validation of customer submitted documents, such payslips and bank statements. With this approach Lendi seeks to achieve their goal of “a same day home loan approval”.

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
A very short(15-20 Minute) loan approval process.

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Currently, Lendi does not offer an approval process at this speed. There are some competitors that do offer fast approval; however, they only offer this as a mortgage manager (and assess for their own loan products on offer). If Lendi was able to offer this as a “broker” they may be the first to do this and be able to gain market share.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Machine Learning and AI to verify and analyse customer input data, submitted supporting documentation, and pulled credit files, together with the automated analysis of customer and product risk analysis and suitability based on external lender metrics as well as property valuations…etc. Furthermore, Lendi would be applying this concept to “broking”, this task would require a large amount of(and regularly updated) data from the 35 lenders on Lendi’s panel (including risk, lending policies…etc).

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
This will offer an automated and faster process from initial customer interaction through to approval with minimum human intervention.
